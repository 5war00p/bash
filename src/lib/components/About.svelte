				I'm a passionate programmer dedicated to continuous learning and skill expansion, with a primary focus on frontend development. As I scale up my expertise by embracing various technologies and frameworks, my goal is to evolve into a T-shaped professional. I thrive on coding for personal projects, contributing to open-source initiatives, engaging in bug bounties, participating in hackathons, and challenging myself with CTFs. Beyond coding, I enjoy watching movies, series, and anime, as well as indulging in book reading 📚 and workouts 💪🏻.
