		description: `Developed a tool to enhance language learning through movies by analyzing subtitle (.srt) files. The application identifies words in the subtitles and displays their meanings based on the user's English proficiency level, which is set at the start. The system operates in real-time, allowing users to watch movies while instantly accessing word definitions, eliminating the need to pause and manually search for meanings. This project integrates natural language processing and user experience design to facilitate immersive learning.`,
