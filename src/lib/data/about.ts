	bio: `I'm a passionate programmer 💻 dedicated to continuous learning and
        skill expansion. Most of my work revolves around frontend development
        🌐, but I also have a solid background as a platform developer, where I
        get to touch every part of the codebase—frontend, backend, cloud
        services setup, and more 🛠️. I thrive on coding for personal projects
        🚀, contributing to open-source initiatives 🌱, engaging in bug bounties
        🐞, participating in hackathons ⚡, and challenging myself with CTFs 🕵️‍♂️.
        Beyond coding, I enjoy watching movies, series, and anime 🎬, as well as
        indulging in book reading 📚, poetry ✍️, and workouts 🏋️‍♂️.`,
